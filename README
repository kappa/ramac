Pure JavaScript autocompletion control.

Pretty comprehensive but rather old. For example, it still has
checks for IE5 (and refuses installation). And the development stopped
before Google Chrome became available. Other than that, it is a piece
of very well debugged code that worked unmodified in production for
many millions of daily users for several years.

Usage:
<script type=text/javascript src=ramac.js></script>
<script type=text/javascript>
ramac_install(document.forms.form1.input1, '/cgi-bin-perl/ramac.pl?prefix=');
</script>
